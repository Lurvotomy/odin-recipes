    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>To get started on the Pizza, we will first need the below ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Bread:</b> I like to use Italian bread or a loaf of French bread (instead of a baguette) to get those nice thick slices.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Butter:</b> softened butter, which will melt into all of the bread nooks & crannies - salted or unsalted butter.(I use 1/2 cup of butter)</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Garlic:</b> Fresh garlic cloves</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Seasoning: </b>Italian Herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven. Set to 200°C/400°F</li>
        <br>
        <li><p><b>Prep your pan & bread.</b> Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or tinfoil. Cut bread into halves</p></li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Garlic Butter.</b> In a small bowl mix the herbs and salt together with the softened butter. Spread it evenly over the top of the bread halves.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Time to cook.</b> Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes until it’s slightly golden brown on the edges.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remove from the oven, and enjoy on it's own or paired with your favourite Italian dish!</p>
